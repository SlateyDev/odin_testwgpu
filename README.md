# ODIN + WGPU test project

This project was created as a challenge to learn how to make the functionalities of
a game engine (starting with a rendering engine) but also to further experiment with
ODIN and to learn how to work with WGPU for cross-platform game development from
scratch.

The project may progress with some poorly positioned code as I learn and improve.

Below are some features I hope to impleent over time if I continue with the project
and don't find something else to fill my spare time. I will continnue to add to the
list as I think of new things that would be interesting to work on.

### FEATURES TODO:

- [x] Simple WGPU sample (drawing a triangle)
- [x] Change shader to support passing a vertex buffer
- [x] Support vertex colours
- [x] Separate wgsl into its own file
- [x] Look at how to support more shaders, materials, meshes
- [x] Support model, view, projection matrices for 3D rendering
- [x] Rendering multiple objects
- [x] Depth buffer
- [x] Texturing
